minicon-harness is a bounded agent worker in one portable file — no
installer, no bundled runtime. It runs one local file/exec task through a
model and prints the final answer on stdout.

`minicon-harness.com` is one launcher file for all six platforms. Run it
directly; on Windows it runs as an `.exe` regardless of the name. The
per-platform archives carry the same native binary with a plain name if you
prefer not to run the APE launcher.

## Quick start

```bash
chmod +x minicon-harness.com          # macOS/Linux once
export HARNESS_API_KEY=sk-...         # your model API key
./minicon-harness.com --version
./minicon-harness.com --root ./playground \
  --task "write hello.txt containing your name, then show it with cat" \
  --allow-cmd ls --allow-cmd cat
```

`--root` (required) confines the `file` tool; `--allow-cmd` names the only
executables the `exec` tool may run. `--base-url` and `--model` point the
loop at any OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint (default:
DeepSeek's). One invocation runs one bounded task: 16 model turns, 64 tool
calls, 10 minutes.

Version VERSION ships company-signed bytes: `minicon-harness.com` and the two
Windows cells carry an Authenticode signature (O=PARTNERNET SOFTWARE PTY LTD)
with an RFC 3161 timestamp. `signing-receipt.json` records the before/after
SHA-256 of each signed file, while `build-receipt.json` and the `.sha256`
sidecars bind every other asset to the packed source.

Version VERSION makes computer use cross-platform. One `cu-abi 1.0` contract
now compiles into three native backends: Win32 `user32`/`gdi32`, macOS
`CoreGraphics`/`CoreFoundation` and Linux `X11`/`XTest`. The two Unix backends
resolve foreign symbols at runtime with `dlopen`/`dlsym`, so the six release
cells still cross-compile on one runner without an X11 or framework link-time
dependency. `disclose` publishes a per-verb capability matrix; `CuHost` admits
only what the compiled cell declares and answers everything else with a named
refusal. Missing OS grants (Screen Recording, Input Monitoring, `$DISPLAY`)
are named boundaries, never a black screenshot or a silent no-op.

Verification is CI, not a laptop: `.github/workflows/cu-platforms.yml` builds,
tests and release-links all three OSes, and `.github/workflows/cu-journeys.yml`
drives a real desktop on each (Linux under Xvfb, macOS in the runner GUI
session, Windows with a titled window). Every effect is read back and an
independent reader recomputes the verdict from `cu-journey.json`. `act:control`
and the typed Win32 child-control arm stay Windows-only; macOS AX and Linux
AT-SPI trees are explicit non-goals.

If something refuses to start, run the file from a terminal and read the
error line; every refusal names the bound it hit.
